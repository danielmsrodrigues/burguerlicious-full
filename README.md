## Project Overview

This is a full-stack project made using React + Typescript + NodeJS.

## What's the Project All About?

My project revolves around an all-inclusive restaurant application, broken down into four core components: the main restaurant website, an admin dashboard, a platform for efficient table order management by staff, and a streamlined kitchen interface for order processing â€“ actions taken in one component have a ripple effect on the others.

**ðŸŽ¨ Front-end:**

I put great emphasis on an intuitive, visually pleasing interface. My aim was to ensure a good user experience across devices.

**ðŸ”§ Back-end:**

I have created several methods where users can create accounts, manage bookings, update menus, and many more. Each project is protected based on the user's permission, so if a client with an account tries to log in to the admin dashboard (or other with a different permission), it will not be allowed.
